This is a simple script made by a student who loves reading, and was thinking of expanding his vocabulary.
The script takes an input, which can be copy and pasted from a PDF, and converts them into a list of unique words. 
There are plans to potentially add support for APIs, but as I still lack the compotency to fully work with them,
it has yet to be added. Planned also is the ability to create a checklist of words to blcklist/whitelist according
to what the user believes is within their ability.

The script requires users to copy and paste in the contents of the books themselves, so long as it is in English. 
Increasing the scope of the project to other languages may be worthwhile, especially those without clear 
distinctions of vocabularies through spaces, such as Chinese or Japanese. This currently lies outside the scope of
my abilities, though it may be worth considering in the near future once I'm willing to tackle more complex solutions.

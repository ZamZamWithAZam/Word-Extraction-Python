This is a simple script made by a student who loves reading, and was thinking of expanding his vocabulary.
The script takes an input, which can be copy and pasted from a PDF, and converts them into a list of unique words. 
There are plans to potentially add support for APIs, but as I still lack the compotency to fully work with them,
it has yet to be added. Planned also is the ability to create a checklist of words to blcklist/whitelist according
to wht the user believes is within their ability.
